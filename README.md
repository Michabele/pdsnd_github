**Post your Bikeshare-Project on GitHub**

Project 3 of the Udacity Nanodegree **Programming for Data Science**

### Description
#### Tasks of Project 3
In this Project the work of Project 2 **Explore US Bikeshare Data** has to be posted and documented on GitHub. 
#### Functionality of Project 2
The bikeshare.py file helps the user to explore data of a bikeshare-company in 3 cities:
* New York City
* Chicago 
* Washington

In a first step the user can decide which data of which city he wants to examine more closely.

In a second step the user is asked if he wants to filter the data by month and/or by day of the week.

Once the user has decided which city to look at and which filter to use, the data is automatically analyzed and the most interesting evaluations are output.


### Files used
To use the functionality of this project you need the mainfile:
* bikeshare.py
